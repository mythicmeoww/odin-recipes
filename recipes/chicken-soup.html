    <ol>
            <li>Dice the onion, celery, and jalapeño (scrape the seeds out of the jalapeño before dicing). 
            Mince the garlic. Add the onion, celery, jalapeño, garlic, and olive oil to a large soup 
            pot and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.</li>
        
             <li>Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, diced tomatoes with chiles 
            (with juices), oregano, and cumin to the pot. Place a lid on the pot, turn the 
            heat up to high, and bring the broth up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down 
            to low and let the pot simmer for 45 minutes.</li>

            <li>After simmering for 45 minutes, carefully remove the chicken breast from the pot and use 
            two forks to shred the meat. Return the shredded meat to the pot. Squeeze the juice of one 
            lime into the soup (2-3 Tbsp juice).</li>
        
            <li>Rinse the cilantro and then roughly chop the leaves. Add the chopped cilantro to the soup, 
                give it a quick stir, then serve. Slice the avocado and add a few slices to each bowl.</li>
