    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Simple Syrup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups fresh blackberries</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tea:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 regular size tea bags</li>
        <li>8 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>ice or frozen blackberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the simple syrup, combine the blackberries and sugar in a medium sized saucepan. 
            Mash the blackberries just slightly with a fork to help release the juices. Stir in 1 cup 
            of water, and then bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, 
            stirring occasionally.</li>
        
        <li>While the simple syrup is simmering, bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a separate saucepan. 
            Add the tea bags, turn off the heat, and allow the tea bags to steep for 3-5 minutes. 
            Remove the tea bags and discard.</li>

        <li>After the simple syrup has finished simmering, turn off the heat and allow it to cool slightly, 
            about 3-4 minutes. Set a fine mesh strainer over the top of a heat proof pitcher 
            (I used a large glass pitcher) and strain the simple syrup, pushing down on the blackberries 
            with a spoon to release all of the juice. Discard the leftover pulp.</li>

        <li>Pour the tea into the pitcher with the simple syrup and the remaining 4 cups of cold water. 
            Stir and refrigerate the tea until cold. Serve over ice, or add frozen blackberries to help 
            keep it cold, as well.</li>
    </ol>
